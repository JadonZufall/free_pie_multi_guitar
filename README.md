# free_pie_multi_guitar
A simple FreePie script that allows mutliple wii-mote guitars to connect to clone hero.

## Downloads
### [Download FreePIE (Required)](http://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/)
This is the software the script runs inside, after downloading and setting up ppJoy you just need to run the script in FreePie and you should be good to go!

### [Download ppJoy (Required)](https://github.com/elitak/PPJoy/releases)
You need to download ppJoy and just add four virtual controllers, you don't need to do anything else to them just add them.  If FreePie is completely crashing it's likely you didn't add all four virtual controllers, if you only want to add a few virtual controllers you can just set the values to False for the controllers you didn't add at the top of the file.
